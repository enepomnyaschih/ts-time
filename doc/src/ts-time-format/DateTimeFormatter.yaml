    description: |
      Formatter of %LocalDateTime to a string. You may initialize a formatter explicitly by using %of method,
      or implicitly by using %ofPattern method. See %DATE_TIME_COMPILERS for supported pattern characters. See
      %parsePattern for general pattern writing guidelines.

    staticMethods:
      of:
        signature: |
          (components: %TemporalFormatComponent<%LocalDateTime>[]): %DateTimeFormatter
        params:
          components: Ordered array of format components.
        returns: Formatter.
        description: Constructs a formatter explicitly by components.

      ofPattern:
        signature: |
          (pattern: string, compilers: Dictionary<%DateTimeCompiler> = %DATE_TIME_COMPILERS): %DateTimeFormatter
        params:
          pattern: Pattern string.
          compilers: Dictionary from supported pattern characters to the respective compilers.
        returns: Formatter.
        description: Constructs a formatter implicitly by pattern. See %parsePattern for details.
