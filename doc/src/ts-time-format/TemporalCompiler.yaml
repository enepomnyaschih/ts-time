    description: |
      <p>Interface of date/time-related type string compiler. Compiler defines a way to format a single component of a
      pattern defined as a sequence of same text characters. For example, "dd" sequence calls:</p>
      <pre>
      %DAY_OF_MONTH_COMPILER.%compile(date, 2);
      </pre>
      <p>Some character sequences write textual language-dependent strings. To handle such cases, context should be
      passed to the compiler:</p>
      <pre>
      const context = {
          monthShortNames: ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"]
      };
      %MONTH_OF_YEAR_COMPILER_M.%compile(date, 3, context); // writes short name of a month, same as "MMM" sequence
      </pre>
      <p>If no context is passed, %DEFAULT_TEMPORAL_CONTEXT representing English localization is being used.</p>

        signature: |
          (value: %T, length: number, context: any): string
        params:
          value: Value to compile.
          length: Number of sequential characters used in a pattern.
          context: Context object.
        returns: Compiled string.
        description: |
          Compiles %value to a string based on number of sequential characters specified in %length and compiler-dependent
          %context object which can be used, in particular, to specify language-specific textual strings.
