  isLeapYear:
    signature: |
      (year: number): boolean
    params:
      year: Absolute year.
    returns: |
      <p>True if this is a leap year.</p>
      <pre>
      (year % 4 === 0) && (year % 100 !== 0 || year % 400 === 0)
      </pre>

  isTimeZoneSupport:
    signature: |
      (): boolean
    returns: |
      <p>True if current browser/environment supports local time zones such as "Europe/Berlin". See <b>Browser
      support</b> at the %home.</p>
    references:
      home:
        file: index
        label: home page

  requireTimeZoneSupport:
    signature: |
      (): boolean
    returns: |
      <p>Same as %isTimeZoneSupport, but also logs a warning message to the browser/environment console if local time
      zones are not supported. The function guarantees that the message is only logged once, on the first function
      call. This function is called internally on the first attempt to instantiate a local %ZoneId.</p>
