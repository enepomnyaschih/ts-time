      Comprises a fixed time interval in milliseconds. As opposed to %Period, it can't comprise a variable-length
      interval such as month, because month duration varies from 28 to 31 days. %Duration is mainly involved to
      manipulate %Instant objects. In particular, %ZonedDateTime.%plusDuration method adds the duration to a respective
      instant, not date/time. It means that if you add %DAY_DURATION to a %ZonedDateTime, you may receive a different
      %LocalTime if time zone offset changes during this day, while real time difference will truly be 24 hours:
      <pre>
      const start = %ZonedDateTime.%parse("2019-10-27T00:00:00.000+02:00[Europe/Berlin]"),
        end = start.%plusDuration(%DAY_DURATION);
      expect(end.%toString()).toBe("2019-10-27T23:00:00.000+01:00[Europe/Berlin]");
      expect(end.%epochMs - start.%epochMs).toBe(24 * %MS_PER_HOUR);
      </pre>
      To ascertain same %LocalTime, you are supposed to add a %Period.
