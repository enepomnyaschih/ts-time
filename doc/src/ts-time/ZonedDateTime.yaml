          New %ZonedDateTime with the specified year and its current month/day of month/time/zone. If such date doesn't
          exist, it shifts the date back to the nearest valid one, preserving the time (e.g. 29th of %FEBRUARY in 2019,
          18:30 [Europe/Berlin] gets shifted to 28th of %FEBRUARY, 18:30 [Europe/Berlin]).
