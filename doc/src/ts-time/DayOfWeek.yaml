      There are exactly 7 days of week, with respective numeric values:
      <ol>
        <li>%MONDAY</li>
        <li>%TUESDAY</li>
        <li>%WEDNESDAY</li>
        <li>%THURSDAY</li>
        <li>%FRIDAY</li>
        <li>%SATURDAY</li>
        <li>%SUNDAY</li>
      </ol>
      You can't construct new days of week, you can only get an existing day of week directly with %of method. With
      this said, the class doesn't provide <b>equals</b> method, as you can merely use JS operator === for equality
      check.
