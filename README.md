### ts-time

TypeScript/JavaScript library of immutable date/time models with time zone support.

This library mimics [Java 8 Date/Time API](https://www.baeldung.com/java-8-date-time-intro),
adjusting its API to the best practices of TypeScript and JavaScript. It uses
[Intl.DateTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat)
API to detect time zone offsets, providing efficient and reliable time zone support in your client code.

ts-time is available as [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-time).
